     * QUESTION 50: Difference between @Component, @Service, @Repository, and @Controller.
     *
     * SHORT ANSWER
     * @Component is the generic stereotype; @Service marks business services; @Repository marks persistence components and enables exception translation; @Controller handles web requests.
     *
     * IN-DEPTH ANSWER
     * - Stereotypes aid scanning and readability.
     * - @Repository can translate persistence exceptions.
     * - @Controller participates in MVC request mapping.
     * - Do not choose annotations randomly; match responsibility.
     *
     * ADVANCED / ARCHITECT VIEW
     * - Explain what Spring proxy/container behavior actually does at runtime, not just the annotation name.
     * - Cover transaction boundaries, validation, security, exception handling, and DTO/entity separation.
     * - Mention integration tests because many Spring behaviors only fail when wiring, proxying, or persistence is real.
     * - Production answer: keep controllers thin, services transactional, repositories persistence-focused, and APIs client-safe.
     *
     * PRODUCTION-READY IMPLEMENTATION SKETCH
     * // @Service: business use case and transaction boundary.
     * // @Repository: persistence access.
     * // @Controller/@RestController: HTTP adapter.
     * // @Component: generic infrastructure component.
     *
     * REAL BACKEND / BANKING USE CASE
     * Use @Service for TransferService and @Repository for LedgerRepository to communicate architectural intent.
     *
     * SENIOR-SDE CHECKLIST
     * - Explain the exact Spring runtime mechanism: proxy, filter chain, bean lifecycle, validation, transaction, or persistence context.
     * - Keep HTTP, business, persistence, and security responsibilities separated.
     * - Cover failure behavior: rollback, safe error response, authorization denial, validation failure, or lazy-loading failure.
     * - Verify with unit, slice, integration, contract, and security tests as appropriate.
     *
     * COMMON MISTAKES
     * - Do not label every class @Component without intent.
     * - Do not put controller logic in services or service logic in repositories.
     * - Do not forget package scanning rules.
     *
     * INTERVIEW TIPS
     * - Give the one-line definition first so the interviewer knows you are grounded.
     * - Immediately connect it to a banking/backend example.
     * - Name the trap, such as race conditions, hidden coupling, inconsistent data, or throughput loss.
     * - Explain the trade-off and the production guardrail you would put in place.
     *
     * FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONS TO BE READY FOR
     * - How does this behave under concurrent requests?
     * - What happens when a downstream service or database operation fails?
     * - How would you test this and prove it works in production?
