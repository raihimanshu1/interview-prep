    /*
     * QUESTION 53: How do you handle exceptions consistently in Spring Boot?
     *
     * SHORT ANSWER
     * Handle exceptions consistently with @ControllerAdvice, domain-specific exceptions, client-safe error DTOs, and clear mapping to HTTP status codes.
     *
     * IN-DEPTH ANSWER
     * - Do not leak stack traces to clients.
     * - Use one response shape for errors.
     * - Log server-side details with correlation IDs.
     * - Keep business exception names meaningful.
     *
     * ADVANCED / ARCHITECT VIEW
     * - Explain what Spring proxy/container behavior actually does at runtime, not just the annotation name.
     * - Cover transaction boundaries, validation, security, exception handling, and DTO/entity separation.
     * - Mention integration tests because many Spring behaviors only fail when wiring, proxying, or persistence is real.
     * - Production answer: keep controllers thin, services transactional, repositories persistence-focused, and APIs client-safe.
     *
     * PRODUCTION-READY IMPLEMENTATION SKETCH
     * // @ControllerAdvice
     * // class ApiExceptionHandler {
     * //   @ExceptionHandler(InsufficientFundsException.class)
     * //   ResponseEntity<ApiError> insufficientFunds(...) { return status(CONFLICT).body(...); }
     * // }
     *
     * REAL BACKEND / BANKING USE CASE
     * Insufficient funds maps to 409, validation errors to 400, authentication failures to 401, and internal failures to 500.
     *
     * SENIOR-SDE CHECKLIST
     * - Explain the exact Spring runtime mechanism: proxy, filter chain, bean lifecycle, validation, transaction, or persistence context.
     * - Keep HTTP, business, persistence, and security responsibilities separated.
     * - Cover failure behavior: rollback, safe error response, authorization denial, validation failure, or lazy-loading failure.
     * - Verify with unit, slice, integration, contract, and security tests as appropriate.
     *
     * COMMON MISTAKES
     * - Do not return raw exception messages to clients.
     * - Do not map every failure to HTTP 500.
     * - Do not forget validation and security exception handling.
     *
     * INTERVIEW TIPS
     * - Give the one-line definition first so the interviewer knows you are grounded.
     * - Immediately connect it to a banking/backend example.
     * - Name the trap, such as race conditions, hidden coupling, inconsistent data, or throughput loss.
     * - Explain the trade-off and the production guardrail you would put in place.
     *
     * FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONS TO BE READY FOR
     * - How does this behave under concurrent requests?
     * - What happens when a downstream service or database operation fails?
     * - How would you test this and prove it works in production?
