     * QUESTION 31: Process vs thread.
     *
     * SHORT ANSWER
     * A process has its own memory space and resources; threads run inside a process and share heap memory with lower creation/context-switch overhead.
     *
     * IN-DEPTH ANSWER
     * - Threads share heap, so shared mutable state needs protection.
     * - Processes isolate failures better but communicate more expensively.
     * - Too many threads increase context switching and memory usage.
     * - Use thread pools instead of creating a thread per request.
     *
     * ADVANCED / ARCHITECT VIEW
     * - Define the shared-state or scheduling problem before naming a concurrency primitive.
     * - Explain Java Memory Model visibility, atomicity, ordering, contention, and cancellation where relevant.
     * - Discuss executor sizing, bounded queues, timeouts, rejection policy, and backpressure under load.
     * - Production answer: prove safety with concurrency tests, load tests, thread dumps, and metrics.
     *
     * PRODUCTION-READY IMPLEMENTATION SKETCH
     * Thread worker = new Thread(() -> processPayment());
     * // In production prefer managed executors/thread pools over ad-hoc threads.
     *
     * REAL BACKEND / BANKING USE CASE
     * A Spring Boot JVM is a process; request handlers run on threads that share application objects.
     *
     * SENIOR-SDE CHECKLIST
     * - Identify shared mutable state, blocking points, cancellation behavior, and thread ownership.
     * - Choose the primitive deliberately: volatile, atomic, lock, transaction, executor, virtual thread, or queue.
     * - Protect capacity with bounded queues, timeouts, rejection policy, and backpressure.
     * - Verify with stress tests, load tests, thread dumps, JFR, and contention metrics.
     *
     * COMMON MISTAKES
     * - Do not create unlimited threads.
     * - Do not put request-specific mutable data in shared objects.
     * - Do not assume thread failure is isolated like process failure.
     *
     * INTERVIEW TIPS
     * - Give the one-line definition first so the interviewer knows you are grounded.
     * - Immediately connect it to a banking/backend example.
     * - Name the trap, such as race conditions, hidden coupling, inconsistent data, or throughput loss.
     * - Explain the trade-off and the production guardrail you would put in place.
     *
     * FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONS TO BE READY FOR
     * - How does this behave under concurrent requests?
     * - What happens when a downstream service or database operation fails?
     * - How would you test this and prove it works in production?
