     * QUESTION 46: Explain Spring IoC and dependency injection.
     *
     * SHORT ANSWER
     * Spring IoC means the container creates and wires objects; dependency injection supplies collaborators from the outside instead of classes constructing them directly.
     *
     * IN-DEPTH ANSWER
     * - Constructor injection is preferred for required dependencies.
     * - IoC improves replacement, testing, and lifecycle management.
     * - Keep business code free from manual new of infrastructure dependencies.
     * - Avoid service locator style unless truly necessary.
     *
     * ADVANCED / ARCHITECT VIEW
     * - Explain what Spring proxy/container behavior actually does at runtime, not just the annotation name.
     * - Cover transaction boundaries, validation, security, exception handling, and DTO/entity separation.
     * - Mention integration tests because many Spring behaviors only fail when wiring, proxying, or persistence is real.
     * - Production answer: keep controllers thin, services transactional, repositories persistence-focused, and APIs client-safe.
     *
     * PRODUCTION-READY IMPLEMENTATION SKETCH
     * final class TransferService {
     *   private final LedgerRepository repository;
     *   TransferService(LedgerRepository repository) { this.repository = repository; }
     * }
     *
     * REAL BACKEND / BANKING USE CASE
     * TransferService receives LedgerRepository and FraudClient from Spring, making dependencies explicit and testable.
     *
     * SENIOR-SDE CHECKLIST
     * - Explain the exact Spring runtime mechanism: proxy, filter chain, bean lifecycle, validation, transaction, or persistence context.
     * - Keep HTTP, business, persistence, and security responsibilities separated.
     * - Cover failure behavior: rollback, safe error response, authorization denial, validation failure, or lazy-loading failure.
     * - Verify with unit, slice, integration, contract, and security tests as appropriate.
     *
     * COMMON MISTAKES
     * - Do not instantiate Spring-managed dependencies manually inside services.
     * - Do not hide dependencies behind static access.
     * - Do not overuse container lookups instead of normal constructor injection.
     *
     * INTERVIEW TIPS
     * - Give the one-line definition first so the interviewer knows you are grounded.
     * - Immediately connect it to a banking/backend example.
     * - Name the trap, such as race conditions, hidden coupling, inconsistent data, or throughput loss.
     * - Explain the trade-off and the production guardrail you would put in place.
     *
     * FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONS TO BE READY FOR
     * - How does this behave under concurrent requests?
     * - What happens when a downstream service or database operation fails?
     * - How would you test this and prove it works in production?
