    /*
     * QUESTION 60: How do you version REST APIs?
     *
     * SHORT ANSWER
     * REST APIs can be versioned through URI paths, headers, or media types; choose a consistent strategy and avoid breaking existing clients silently.
     *
     * IN-DEPTH ANSWER
     * - Use additive changes when possible.
     * - Version only when contract semantics break.
     * - Publish deprecation timelines.
     * - Keep old versions monitored until clients migrate.
     *
     * ADVANCED / ARCHITECT VIEW
     * - Explain what Spring proxy/container behavior actually does at runtime, not just the annotation name.
     * - Cover transaction boundaries, validation, security, exception handling, and DTO/entity separation.
     * - Mention integration tests because many Spring behaviors only fail when wiring, proxying, or persistence is real.
     * - Production answer: keep controllers thin, services transactional, repositories persistence-focused, and APIs client-safe.
     *
     * PRODUCTION-READY IMPLEMENTATION SKETCH
     * // /api/v1/transfers keeps old contract.
     * // /api/v2/transfers introduces a new field meaning or required input.
     * // Additive optional fields usually do not require a new major version.
     *
     * REAL BACKEND / BANKING USE CASE
     * A bank may expose /v1/transfers while introducing /v2/transfers for changed response semantics.
     *
     * SENIOR-SDE CHECKLIST
     * - Explain the exact Spring runtime mechanism: proxy, filter chain, bean lifecycle, validation, transaction, or persistence context.
     * - Keep HTTP, business, persistence, and security responsibilities separated.
     * - Cover failure behavior: rollback, safe error response, authorization denial, validation failure, or lazy-loading failure.
     * - Verify with unit, slice, integration, contract, and security tests as appropriate.
     *
     * COMMON MISTAKES
     * - Do not break existing clients silently.
     * - Do not create a new version for every tiny additive field.
     * - Do not keep old versions forever without monitoring and retirement plans.
     *
     * INTERVIEW TIPS
     * - Give the one-line definition first so the interviewer knows you are grounded.
     * - Immediately connect it to a banking/backend example.
     * - Name the trap, such as race conditions, hidden coupling, inconsistent data, or throughput loss.
     * - Explain the trade-off and the production guardrail you would put in place.
     *
     * FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONS TO BE READY FOR
     * - How does this behave under concurrent requests?
     * - What happens when a downstream service or database operation fails?
     * - How would you test this and prove it works in production?
