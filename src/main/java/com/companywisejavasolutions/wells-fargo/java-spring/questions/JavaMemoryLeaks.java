     * QUESTION 16: What is a memory leak in Java if garbage collection exists?
     *
     * SHORT ANSWER
     * A Java memory leak happens when objects are still reachable but no longer useful, so garbage collection cannot reclaim them.
     *
     * IN-DEPTH ANSWER
     * - Bound caches and define eviction policies.
     * - Remove listeners and callbacks when lifecycle ends.
     * - Clear ThreadLocal values in finally blocks.
     * - Use heap dumps and allocation profiling to verify.
     *
     * ADVANCED / ARCHITECT VIEW
     * - Move from definition to runtime behavior: allocation, reachability, class metadata, JIT, GC pauses, or memory areas.
     * - Discuss measurement first: GC logs, heap dumps, JFR, allocation profiles, thread dumps, and latency percentiles.
     * - Explain tuning trade-offs and why blindly changing flags or heap size is risky.
     * - Production answer: optimize based on workload evidence and SLO impact.
     *
     * PRODUCTION-READY IMPLEMENTATION SKETCH
     * private static final Map<String, String> cache = new LinkedHashMap<>();
     * // Production cache should use max size/TTL, not grow forever.
     *
     * REAL BACKEND / BANKING USE CASE
     * Static collections, unbounded caches, listeners, and ThreadLocals commonly retain old request data.
     *
     * SENIOR-SDE CHECKLIST
     * - Explain the JVM/runtime mechanism behind the concept, not only the Java syntax.
     * - Use evidence: GC logs, heap dumps, JFR, allocation profiles, class histograms, or thread dumps.
     * - Connect the topic to SLO impact: latency, throughput, memory footprint, startup, or deployment stability.
     * - Tune only after measuring under production-like workload.
     *
     * COMMON MISTAKES
     * - Do not assume garbage collection prevents all leaks.
     * - Do not keep request objects in static fields.
     * - Do not use unbounded caches without eviction.
     *
     * INTERVIEW TIPS
     * - Give the one-line definition first so the interviewer knows you are grounded.
     * - Immediately connect it to a banking/backend example.
     * - Name the trap, such as race conditions, hidden coupling, inconsistent data, or throughput loss.
     * - Explain the trade-off and the production guardrail you would put in place.
     *
     * FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONS TO BE READY FOR
     * - How does this behave under concurrent requests?
     * - What happens when a downstream service or database operation fails?
     * - How would you test this and prove it works in production?
