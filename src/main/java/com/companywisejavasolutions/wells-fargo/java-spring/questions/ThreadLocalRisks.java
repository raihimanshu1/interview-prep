    /*
     * QUESTION 45: Explain thread-local and its risks in app servers.
     *
     * SHORT ANSWER
     * ThreadLocal stores data per thread, but in pooled application threads values can leak between requests unless removed reliably.
     *
     * IN-DEPTH ANSWER
     * - Use ThreadLocal sparingly.
     * - Always remove in finally blocks.
     * - Prefer explicit parameters for business data.
     * - Be extra careful with async boundaries where work moves threads.
     *
     * ADVANCED / ARCHITECT VIEW
     * - Define the shared-state or scheduling problem before naming a concurrency primitive.
     * - Explain Java Memory Model visibility, atomicity, ordering, contention, and cancellation where relevant.
     * - Discuss executor sizing, bounded queues, timeouts, rejection policy, and backpressure under load.
     * - Production answer: prove safety with concurrency tests, load tests, thread dumps, and metrics.
     *
     * PRODUCTION-READY IMPLEMENTATION SKETCH
     * try {
     *   CURRENT_USER.set(userId);
     *   handleRequest();
     * } finally {
     *   CURRENT_USER.remove(); // critical in thread pools
     * }
     *
     * REAL BACKEND / BANKING USE CASE
     * Storing customer context in ThreadLocal without cleanup can expose wrong context on the next request using the same thread.
     *
     * SENIOR-SDE CHECKLIST
     * - Identify shared mutable state, blocking points, cancellation behavior, and thread ownership.
     * - Choose the primitive deliberately: volatile, atomic, lock, transaction, executor, virtual thread, or queue.
     * - Protect capacity with bounded queues, timeouts, rejection policy, and backpressure.
     * - Verify with stress tests, load tests, thread dumps, JFR, and contention metrics.
     *
     * COMMON MISTAKES
     * - Do not forget remove in pooled threads.
     * - Do not use ThreadLocal as hidden global state.
     * - Do not expect ThreadLocal values to move automatically across async execution.
     *
     * INTERVIEW TIPS
     * - Give the one-line definition first so the interviewer knows you are grounded.
     * - Immediately connect it to a banking/backend example.
     * - Name the trap, such as race conditions, hidden coupling, inconsistent data, or throughput loss.
     * - Explain the trade-off and the production guardrail you would put in place.
     *
     * FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONS TO BE READY FOR
     * - How does this behave under concurrent requests?
     * - What happens when a downstream service or database operation fails?
     * - How would you test this and prove it works in production?
