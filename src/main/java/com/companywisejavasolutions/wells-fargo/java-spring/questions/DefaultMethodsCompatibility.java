    /*
     * QUESTION 27: How do default interface methods affect backward compatibility?
     *
     * SHORT ANSWER
     * Default methods let interfaces add behavior without breaking existing implementers, but they can create ambiguity and should not become hidden business logic.
     *
     * IN-DEPTH ANSWER
     * - Use defaults for small compatibility behavior.
     * - Document when implementations should override.
     * - Resolve diamond conflicts explicitly.
     * - Avoid default methods that depend on mutable implementation state.
     *
     * ADVANCED / ARCHITECT VIEW
     * - Define the concept, describe internal behavior, and explain the production consequence.
     * - State when to use it, when not to use it, and what trade-off is being accepted.
     * - Include failure handling, testing approach, and observability signal.
     * - Production answer: connect the topic to a real banking/backend scenario.
     *
     * PRODUCTION-READY IMPLEMENTATION SKETCH
     * interface PaymentGateway {
     *   default boolean supportsCurrency(String currency) {
     *     return "USD".equals(currency);
     *   }
     * }
     *
     * REAL BACKEND / BANKING USE CASE
     * Adding default supportsCurrency to PaymentGateway can keep old implementations compiling while new ones override when needed.
     *
     * SENIOR-SDE CHECKLIST
     * - Define the concept clearly, then explain the production consequence.
     * - Name when to use it, when not to use it, and the trade-off.
     * - Add failure handling, test strategy, and observability.
     * - Use a banking/backend example so the answer sounds practical.
     *
     * COMMON MISTAKES
     * - Do not hide complex rules in default methods.
     * - Do not ignore conflicting defaults from multiple interfaces.
     * - Do not use defaults as a replacement for proper service design.
     *
     * INTERVIEW TIPS
     * - Give the one-line definition first so the interviewer knows you are grounded.
     * - Immediately connect it to a banking/backend example.
     * - Name the trap, such as race conditions, hidden coupling, inconsistent data, or throughput loss.
     * - Explain the trade-off and the production guardrail you would put in place.
     *
     * FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONS TO BE READY FOR
     * - How does this behave under concurrent requests?
     * - What happens when a downstream service or database operation fails?
     * - How would you test this and prove it works in production?
