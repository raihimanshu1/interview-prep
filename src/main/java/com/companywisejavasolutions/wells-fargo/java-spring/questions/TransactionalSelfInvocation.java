    /*
     * QUESTION 55: Common pitfalls of @Transactional self-invocation.
     *
     * SHORT ANSWER
     * Self-invocation bypasses Spring proxy advice, so calling a @Transactional method from another method in the same class may not start a transaction.
     *
     * IN-DEPTH ANSWER
     * - Move transactional method to another Spring bean.
     * - Call through the proxied bean only when appropriate.
     * - Prefer clear service boundaries over proxy tricks.
     * - Write integration tests for transaction propagation behavior.
     *
     * ADVANCED / ARCHITECT VIEW
     * - Explain what Spring proxy/container behavior actually does at runtime, not just the annotation name.
     * - Cover transaction boundaries, validation, security, exception handling, and DTO/entity separation.
     * - Mention integration tests because many Spring behaviors only fail when wiring, proxying, or persistence is real.
     * - Production answer: keep controllers thin, services transactional, repositories persistence-focused, and APIs client-safe.
     *
     * PRODUCTION-READY IMPLEMENTATION SKETCH
     * // Better: AuditService is a separate bean.
     * // transferService calls auditService.writeAuditRequiresNew(...).
     * // Spring proxy can then apply the transactional advice.
     *
     * REAL BACKEND / BANKING USE CASE
     * A public method this.writeAudit() inside the same service will not trigger REQUIRES_NEW proxy behavior.
     *
     * SENIOR-SDE CHECKLIST
     * - Explain the exact Spring runtime mechanism: proxy, filter chain, bean lifecycle, validation, transaction, or persistence context.
     * - Keep HTTP, business, persistence, and security responsibilities separated.
     * - Cover failure behavior: rollback, safe error response, authorization denial, validation failure, or lazy-loading failure.
     * - Verify with unit, slice, integration, contract, and security tests as appropriate.
     *
     * COMMON MISTAKES
     * - Do not call this.transactionalMethod() and expect Spring proxy advice.
     * - Do not solve this by making methods public only; proxy routing still matters.
     * - Do not skip integration tests for transaction boundaries.
     *
     * INTERVIEW TIPS
     * - Give the one-line definition first so the interviewer knows you are grounded.
     * - Immediately connect it to a banking/backend example.
     * - Name the trap, such as race conditions, hidden coupling, inconsistent data, or throughput loss.
     * - Explain the trade-off and the production guardrail you would put in place.
     *
     * FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONS TO BE READY FOR
     * - How does this behave under concurrent requests?
     * - What happens when a downstream service or database operation fails?
     * - How would you test this and prove it works in production?
