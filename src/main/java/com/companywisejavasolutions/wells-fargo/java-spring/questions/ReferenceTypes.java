     * QUESTION 19: What are strong, weak, soft, and phantom references?
     *
     * SHORT ANSWER
     * Strong references keep objects alive; soft references are cleared under memory pressure; weak references do not prevent GC; phantom references support post-mortem cleanup tracking.
     *
     * IN-DEPTH ANSWER
     * - Use strong references for normal application ownership.
     * - Use weak references for canonicalizing/caches only with clear need.
     * - Do not rely on soft references for predictable caching.
     * - Phantom references are advanced cleanup tools.
     *
     * ADVANCED / ARCHITECT VIEW
     * - Move from definition to runtime behavior: allocation, reachability, class metadata, JIT, GC pauses, or memory areas.
     * - Discuss measurement first: GC logs, heap dumps, JFR, allocation profiles, thread dumps, and latency percentiles.
     * - Explain tuning trade-offs and why blindly changing flags or heap size is risky.
     * - Production answer: optimize based on workload evidence and SLO impact.
     *
     * PRODUCTION-READY IMPLEMENTATION SKETCH
     * Map<Object, String> metadata = new WeakHashMap<>();
     * // When key is no longer strongly referenced elsewhere, entry can disappear after GC.
     *
     * REAL BACKEND / BANKING USE CASE
     * WeakHashMap can associate metadata with objects without preventing those keys from being garbage collected.
     *
     * SENIOR-SDE CHECKLIST
     * - Explain the JVM/runtime mechanism behind the concept, not only the Java syntax.
     * - Use evidence: GC logs, heap dumps, JFR, allocation profiles, class histograms, or thread dumps.
     * - Connect the topic to SLO impact: latency, throughput, memory footprint, startup, or deployment stability.
     * - Tune only after measuring under production-like workload.
     *
     * COMMON MISTAKES
     * - Do not use soft references as a reliable cache strategy.
     * - Do not expect weak references to clear immediately.
     * - Do not use phantom references unless you understand ReferenceQueue handling.
     *
     * INTERVIEW TIPS
     * - Give the one-line definition first so the interviewer knows you are grounded.
     * - Immediately connect it to a banking/backend example.
     * - Name the trap, such as race conditions, hidden coupling, inconsistent data, or throughput loss.
     * - Explain the trade-off and the production guardrail you would put in place.
     *
     * FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONS TO BE READY FOR
     * - How does this behave under concurrent requests?
     * - What happens when a downstream service or database operation fails?
     * - How would you test this and prove it works in production?
