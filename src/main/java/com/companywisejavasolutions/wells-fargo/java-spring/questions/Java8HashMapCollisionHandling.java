     * QUESTION 12: What changed in Java 8 HashMap collision handling?
     *
     * SHORT ANSWER
     * Java 8 HashMap can convert heavily-collided bucket chains into red-black trees, improving worst-case lookup from linear toward logarithmic time when keys are comparable enough.
     *
     * IN-DEPTH ANSWER
     * - Treeification happens only after thresholds and sufficient table capacity.
     * - Good hashCode implementations still matter.
     * - Tree bins add overhead, so normal buckets remain lists.
     * - HashMap remains not thread-safe.
     *
     * ADVANCED / ARCHITECT VIEW
     * - Start with language/library semantics, then connect to correctness, maintainability, and performance.
     * - Explain edge cases interviewers test: mutability, equality, erasure, ordering, nulls, and API contracts.
     * - Show when the feature improves design and when it makes code harder to read or maintain.
     * - Production answer: prefer simple, explicit code until the abstraction removes real complexity.
     *
     * PRODUCTION-READY IMPLEMENTATION SKETCH
     * // Good key design is still the production fix:
     * record AccountKey(String bankId, String accountId) { }
     * Map<AccountKey, String> cache = new HashMap<>();
     *
     * REAL BACKEND / BANKING USE CASE
     * This protects a map from severe collision chains but does not make bad keys acceptable.
     *
     * SENIOR-SDE CHECKLIST
     * - Explain the language or collection contract and the edge cases interviewers usually test.
     * - Show how mutability, equality, ordering, generics, null handling, or readability affects production correctness.
     * - Choose APIs based on clear trade-offs, not habit or syntax preference.
     * - Verify with focused unit tests and realistic examples; benchmark only when performance is actually relevant.
     *
     * COMMON MISTAKES
     * - Do not rely on tree bins to compensate for poor hashCode.
     * - Do not forget HashMap is still not thread-safe.
     * - Do not assume every collision bucket immediately becomes a tree.
     *
     * INTERVIEW TIPS
     * - Give the one-line definition first so the interviewer knows you are grounded.
     * - Immediately connect it to a banking/backend example.
     * - Name the trap, such as race conditions, hidden coupling, inconsistent data, or throughput loss.
     * - Explain the trade-off and the production guardrail you would put in place.
     *
     * FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONS TO BE READY FOR
     * - How does this behave under concurrent requests?
     * - What happens when a downstream service or database operation fails?
     * - How would you test this and prove it works in production?
